# Local component laboratory

This is an isolated compatibility experiment, not the Sbarbase product or a production deployment. It initially compares three environment databases on one PostgreSQL 17 instance with original Supabase Auth and PostgREST services. Storage, Realtime, functions, UI, recovery and upgrade gates remain separate work.

All containers use the `sbarbase-lab` ownership label, loopback-only random published ports, dedicated networking and a dedicated volume. Secrets stay in ignored `.secrets/`. Run with `/usr/bin/python3 lab/run.py up`, `status`, or `stop`. Stop preserves data. No existing services are managed.
